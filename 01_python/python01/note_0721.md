## **Why we use pyhon**
- Easy to use
- Assistant python community
- Python can use variaty
- Have plenty library
- Java script is the first language with developer
  - Second is python
- Have advantage on algorithmic logical

## **How to start python**
- In VScode
  - When we run codes do not use run button
    - for famlier to CLI circumstance
    - Use CLI: ls

# **Data type**
method(?) 

## Sequence Types
- Have sequence but not order(organize)
- Each value have index
  - That mean can indexing
- Slicing
  - Can extract portion of all
- Length
  - Have length
- Iteration

### str
#### Can't revise inner values
  - Immutable
  - use '' or ""
    - When we use '' in test, then wrap in ""

#### f-string
  - f'{expression}
    - If you use f-string, can use formating by variable

#### Can slicing
  - first value have index[0]
  - When use [2:4] it is mean 2,3 not 4
    - That '2' mean also third
  - The last value have index[-1]
  - If you write [:3] is the same as [0:3]
    - [::2] mean zero to last with 2 
    
#### Method
- s.replace(old, new[,count])
  - If you use that can change str type values


### List
- Include more than 0 object
- **List can exchange**
  - L.append(x)
    - Add now value at last
  - L.extend(m)
    - Add another list: iterable
  - L.pop(i)
    - Return last value and remove that 
    - But usually not use

### tuple
- Immutable: Can't revise
  - almost move in pthon inner movement
