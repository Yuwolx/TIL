# This note was written about the basics of Python.
## **Why we use pyhon**
- Easy to read and write
- Supported by a large, active community
- Versatile — usable in many fields such as: Wep developer, Data,,, 
- Comes with many built-in and third-party libraries
- Most popular languages among developers: JAVA scripts
  - Second is python
-  Excellent for learning algorithmic thinking and logical problem solving

## **How to start python**
- use VScode
  - Don't rely on the "run" button
    - for get familer with the CLI circumstance
    - Use CLI: ls

# **Data type**
method(?) 

## Sequence Types
**A sequence type is a data structure that stores items in a specific order.**
- Elements are stored in a specific order
  - Not ordered by ascending or descending, Just have index
- Each element have index
  - Can indexing

- Slicing
  - You can extract a portion of the sequence

- Length
  - Use len() to get the number of elements\

- Iteration: repeating a process
  -  Can be used in a for loop to go through elements one by one

### str
#### Can't revise inner values
  - Immutable: cannot modify
  - Use single quotes ' ' or double quotes " " to define strings
    - When we should use '' in text, wrap in ""

#### f-string
  - f'{expression}: Syntax
    - Allows you to insert variables or expressions directly inside a string

#### Slicing: Strings support slicing just like lists
  - first value have index[0]
  - When use [2:4] it is mean 2,3 not 4
    - That '2' means also third
  - The last value have index[-1]
  - If you write [:3] is the same as [0:3]
    - [::2] mean zero to last with 2 
    
#### Method
- s.replace(old, new[,count])
  - Replaces all or a limited number of old substrings with a new one
'''
s = "apple apple"
s2 = s.replace("apple", "banana", 1)  # "banana apple"
'''

#### Summary
Feature	Description
Immutable:	Strings can't be changed in-place
f-string:	Format strings using variables
Slicing:	Extract parts of the string
replace():	Change part of a string (returns new one)


### List
**A list is a mutable (changeable) collection that can store multiple items.**
- Can include 0 or more objects
- **Mutable**: values can be added, changed, or removed
  - L.append(x)
    - Add an item to the end of the list
  - L.extend(iterable)
    - 	Adds each element from another iterable (like a list) to the end
  - L.pop(i)
    - Return last value and remove that 
    - But usually not use
'''L = [1, 2, 3]
L.append(4)         # [1, 2, 3, 4]
L.extend([5, 6])    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
L.pop()             # returns 6 → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
'''


### tuple
**A tuple is like a list, but immutable — it cannot be changed after creation**
- almost wokring in inner movement of python
- Defined with parentheses ()

- Used for fixed data or internal operations in Python

- Faster and safer than lists for read-only data

### range
**range() generates a sequence of numbers — commonly used in for loops.**
- range(start, end, step)
 - create squence in numerical range
 - If use -1 of step
  - Int wil decline 
'''
list(range(1, 5))       # [1, 2, 3, 4]
list(range(5))          # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
list(range(10, 5, -1))  # [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]
'''

## What is an Iterable?
An iterable is any object that you can loop over using a for loop.
Python’s iterables include things like:

list
tuple
str (string)
set
dict
range()


## Non-Sequence Types
### dict (dictionary)
- Uses {key: value} format
  - **Keys are immutable (cannot be changed)**
- A key must be unique and acts as a unique identifier
- Values can be of any data type

    - e.g., list, dict, int, string, etc.
- You can retrieve a value by providing its corresponding key

### dict's methods
- D.get(key) = value
- dict['key'] = value
  - **If those key not exist, get method retuen 'None'**
  - dict['key'] return  key error

### Set
- Do not have sequence and same values in another
  - Unique 
- set()
  - Create empry set
  - have {1,2,3} format
- set1 | set2
  - Can add two sets
- **method**
  - s.add(x)
    - add additional value in set
      - If there are same value already, keep current status

## Other types
### None
- Return when there is no value
- Return when function haven't output

### Boolean
- Express True and False

## ETC
### Copy
  - Can change types and immutable types have different copy way

- Copy category
  - Assignment
    - b = a : 'a' and 'b' see same list
   - Basic copy method

  - Shallow copy
    - b = a[:] : 'b' see new assignmeted list
      - If a have list in list(inner), 'b' see same inner list, so when change b's inner list, a's inner list also revise

  - Deep copy
    - deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
    - a and b see different inner list

### Type conversion
Have table in notion Day 10

### Operator
- == : same
- != : not same
  - == and != mean equility
- is : same
  - is and not is mean identify

- And
 - Only True and True retuen True

- Short-circuit evaluation
 - and
  - When fist value is False return False directly

#### Membership operator 
   - in
   - not in
    - return Boolean

#### Sequence type operator
- +, *

## Map
**map's first argument is function**
obj  = map(int, '123')
print(type(obj)) #<class 'map'>
class map is iterable
object is int's lump

almost time usually change type to list -> 명시적 형변환
my_list = list(obj)
print(my_list) #[1,2,3]

def func(num)
  return num **2
obj2 = list(map(func,[1,2,3])) # [1,4,9]

If you don't need again, you can use it lambda for anonimus
obj3 = list(map(lambda x:x **2, [1,2,3]))

#case 3
user_input = '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'
arr = list(map(int, user_input.split(' '))) # [1,2,3,4,5]

for i in arr:
  print(item * 2) #2,4,6,8,10

### LEGB rule
# Local
# En-Closed
# global
# Built-in
