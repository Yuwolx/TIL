# This note was written about the basics of Python.
## **Why we use pyhon**
- Easy to use
- Assistant python community
- Python can use variaty
- Have plenty library
- Java script is the first language with developer
  - Second is python
- Have advantage on algorithmic logical

## **How to start python**
- In VScode
  - When we run codes do not use run button
    - for famlier to CLI circumstance
    - Use CLI: ls

# **Data type**
method(?) 

## Sequence Types
- Have sequence but not order(organize)
- Each value have index
  - That mean can indexing
- Slicing
  - Can extract portion of all
- Length
  - Have length
- Iteration

### str
#### Can't revise inner values
  - Immutable
  - use '' or ""
    - When we use '' in test, then wrap in ""

#### f-string
  - f'{expression}
    - If you use f-string, can use formating by variable

#### Can slicing
  - first value have index[0]
  - When use [2:4] it is mean 2,3 not 4
    - That '2' mean also third
  - The last value have index[-1]
  - If you write [:3] is the same as [0:3]
    - [::2] mean zero to last with 2 
    
#### Method
- s.replace(old, new[,count])
  - If you use that can change str type values


### List
- Include more than 0 object
- **List can exchange**
  - L.append(x)
    - Add now value at last
  - L.extend(m)
    - Add another list: iterable
  - L.pop(i)
    - Return last value and remove that 
    - But usually not use

### tuple
- Immutable: Can't revise
  - almost move in pthon inner movement

### range
- range(start, end, step)
 - create squence in numerical range
 - If use -1 of step
  - Int wil decline 


## Non-Sequence Types
### dict (dictionary)
- Uses {key: value} format
  - **Keys are immutable (cannot be changed)**
- A key must be unique and acts as a unique identifier
- Values can be of any data type
    - e.g., list, dict, int, string, etc.
- You can retrieve a value by providing its corresponding key

### dict's methods
- D.get(key) = value
- dict['key'] = value
  - **If those key not exist, get method retuen 'None'**
  - dict['key'] return  key error

### Set
- Do not have sequence and same values in another
  - Unique 
- set()
  - Create empry set
  - have {1,2,3} format
- set1 | set2
  - Can add two sets
- **method**
  - s.add(x)
    - add additional value in set
      - If there are same value already, keep current status

## Other types
### None
- Return when there is no value
- Return when function haven't output

### Boolean
- Express True and False

## ETC
### Copy
  - Can change types and immutable types have different copy way

- Copy category
  - Assignment
    - b = a : 'a' and 'b' see same list
   - Basic copy method

  - Shallow copy
    - b = a[:] : 'b' see new assignmeted list
      - If a have list in list(inner), 'b' see same inner list, so when change b's inner list, a's inner list also revise

  - Deep copy
    - deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
    - a and b see different inner list

### Type conversion
Have table in notion Day 10

### Operator
- == : same
- != : not same
  - == and != mean equility
- is : same
  - is and not is mean identify

- And
 - Only True and True retuen True

- Short-circuit evaluation
 - and
  - When fist value is False return False directly

#### Membership operator 
   - in
   - not in
    - return Boolean

#### Sequence type operator
- +, *
