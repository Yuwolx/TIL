# Database
**The technique to store data is the most important.**

## Role of a Database
- Create  
- Read  
- Update  
- Delete  

### Relational Database
- Stores pointers that connect tables to one another  
- Provides access through defined relationships  

## Relation
- Tables have logical connections, often through primary keys  

## RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
Examples:  
- SQLite  
- MySQL  
- PostgreSQL  
- Oracle Database  

## Database Modeling
- The most important phase to ensure efficiency, consistency, and integrity  
- Prevents anomalies (data inconsistencies and faults)  

### Anomalies
Types of anomalies:  
- Insert Anomaly  
- Update Anomaly  
- Delete Anomaly  

### Normalization
1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**  
   - Each entity is unique  
   - Each column must be atomic (indivisible)  

2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**  
   - Applies when a table has a composite primary key  
   - Every non-key attribute must depend on the whole primary key  
   - If an attribute depends only on part of the key, split the table  

3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**  
   - Non-key attributes must not depend on other non-key attributes  

4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**  
   - Every determinant must be a candidate key  

## SQL Statements
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines data structures (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)  
- **DQL (Data Query Language):** Queries data (SELECT)  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Manipulates data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)  
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Controls access (GRANT, REVOKE)
